		description = "The Vermintide Mod Framework (VMF) is an open-source, community-run framework of modules that provides enhanced modding capabilities and support. The framework is designed to be both independent and lightweight; making no changes to gameplay on its own.

Mods created for the project may utilize:
[list]
    [*]Mod options (opened from the main menu or by pressing F4)
    [*]Shared function hooks
    [*]Chat commands
    [*]Keybinds
    [*]Mutator support (only available in Vermintide 1 at this time)
    [*]Network calls
    [*]Rewritten, lightweight mod functions
    [*]An on-event call system
[/list]

The Vermintide Mod Framework originally started in Warhammer End Times: Vermintide as an unofficial modding platform. In the time since, VMF has been rewritten and redesigned with contributions from many unique members of the community; culminating in this unified project made for the arrival of official mod support.

If you're interested in creating mods with VMF, please check out [url=https://vmf-docs.verminti.de/]the project's wiki[/url].

Use:

pl.tablex.deepcompare(t1, t2)

Or to require individual modules:
local tablex = require'pl.tablex'
tablex.deepcompare(t1, t2)

Please DO NOT use require 'pl', this pollutes the global table.

Some modules have been removed due to security concerns: sip and lapp, and those related to file access.
Note that using the pretty module to print tables can cause a stack overflow due to it not handling recursion in table members.

- Boon Manager really helps: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2734566701

It adds entirely new talents to careers, or new special attacks to weapons while reworking or adjusting most of the remaining ones. 
It also pays respect to some of the community's desires for QoL and innovation and puts a heavier focus on mechanics with more skill ceiling instead of those that reward bad play (or intentionally abusing) like the insane amount of cooldown reduction for taking damage.

Class Balance considers Cataclysm 3 Deathwish the baseline for all balance changes made, which means that everything will also work well on any difficulty below.
Accordingly, lots of weapons have seen buffs to be on par with this difficulty baseline whereas some other weapons, that were overperforming out of the box, have been nerfed. As a result, the game has still been made significantly harder overall.

Everyone (Host + clients) needs the mod in order for it to work.

This mod removes the cooldown for all ultimates, ensuring that purple bar is full at all times!

Cooldowns can be enabled/disabled or their length modified in the <F4> mod menu. 

Note: The cooldown length won't go any higher than their vanilla cooldowns (e.g. setting 100 seconds on Waystalker's ult defaults down to vanilla 70 seconds). I can change this to allow longer cooldowns if people really want this feature as well.

While optional, I also suggest subscribing to \"Neuter Ult Effects\" by prop joe if you don't want to lag your computer when spamming certain ults: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1384066089"

* Friend told me to remove them. Some of these grenaid boons and career skills are good imo, but he doesn't agree. This is a very opinionated pick.

What is removed for battle wizard only: 
[list]
[*] Lingering Flames - Siennas burning effects now last until the affected enemy dies. Burning effects does not stack
[*] Rechannel - When Tranquillity is active, Siennaâ€™s ranged charge time is reduced by 40%.
[/list]

What is removed for pyromancer only:
[list]
[*] Exhaust - Ult removes overcharge, pyro in chaos wastes want high charge for crit boon synergy. Getting this out of a random boon chest will immediately break build.
[/list]

What is removed for shade only:
[list]
[*] Shadowstep - Infiltrate causes Kerillian to blink forward, passing through enemies.
[/list]

overwrites DeusPowerUpExclusionList, not compatible with other mods that change the table.

This mod lets you toss(catapult) the dwarf on your team by pinging them when you are close enough. The toss is done in the direction they're currently facing, with a 45Â° incline.
You can toss ally dwarfs that are both hosting and don't have the mod installed. However, each player that wants to be able to do a toss will need to install it.

I don't intend to apply for the mod to be sanctioned, it's only meant for some fun. As such, I left some debugging stuff in as they were fun too.

If you see an error message in the chat it's due to an odd behaviour I couldn't work around, nothing to worry about but hopefully I can get rid of it soon.

		description = "A library of functions to simplify working with mod items.

This mod does nothing on its own. It only serves as a modders' resource for adding temporary vanilla and custom items to a player's inventory. Eventually, it will also handle making these items display only to mod-using players in the trusted realm. This change would prevent custom item mods from impacting the experiences of unmodded players, a likely condition of sanctioned custom item mods.

Non-cosmetic mod items that provide an advantage will likely never be sanctioned, and sanctioning this library won't allow their use in the trusted realm.

INSTALLATION: Make sure that More Items Library is underneath VMF in your launcher's mod order, but higher than any mods that depend on it.

NOTE: This library is currently in development. Please expect instability.

[url=https://github.com/Aussiemon/VT2-More-Items-Library]Project Source [Git][/url]

Usage:
	
		[b]- If the item is completely new, and does not yet have an ItemMasterList entry:[/b]
		
			1. Create a new table
			
			2. Fill that table with the relevant regular fields of an ItemMasterList entry
			
			3. Insert your new entry into an array
			
			4. Pass that array to mod.add_mod_items_to_masterlist()
			
			Your item now has an ItemMasterList and NetworkLookup entry. ANY COMPLETELY NEW ITEM WILL CURRENTLY CRASH LOBBY PLAYERS WHO DO NOT HAVE MATCHING ITEM LISTS.
			
		[b]- When an item has an ItemMasterList entry, it can be added to your inventory:[/b]
		
			1. Use table.clone to copy the ItemMasterList entry
			
			2. Add a mod_data table to your entry copy (entry.mod_data = {})
			
			3. To this mod_data table, add any of the fields listed below in the backend_template for your item's slot_type. To look at your existing items for reference material, call the Vermintide Mod Framework's 'dtf' function on the return result of PlayFabMirror.get_all_inventory_items().
					
			4. Insert your new entry into an array
			
			5. Pass that array to mod.add_mod_items_to_local_backend() with your mod's name
			
			For example:[code]
local entry = table.clone(ItemMasterList[\"ring_06\"])
entry.mod_data = {
	backend_id = \"something_unique\",
	ItemInstanceId = \"same as backend_id\",
	CustomData = {
		traits = \"[\\\"ring_potion_duration\\\"]\",
		power_level = \"300\",
		properties = \"{\\\"power_vs_skaven\\\":1,\\\"power_vs_unarmoured\\\":1}\"
	},
	traits = {
		\"ring_potion_duration\"
	},
	power_level = 300,
	properties = {
		power_vs_unarmoured = 1,
		power_vs_skaven = 1,
	},
}
mod:add_mod_items_to_local_backend({entry}, \"your mod name\")[/code]
			
			Your item is now 'owned' for the game session, and will appear in item menus.
	
		[b]- When trying to remove items created by MoreItemsLibrary:[/b]

			1. Create a numerical array of backend_ids for removal (e.g. local items = { \"one\", \"two\", \"three\" })
	
			2. Pass that array to mod.remove_mod_items_from_local_backend() with your mod's name"

Some things that might not be obvious:
[list]
[*] You can right-click on a loadout number to restore that loadout without having to open the loadout details panel.
[*] You can rename a loadout by clicking on its current name at the top of the loadout details panel.
[*] Loadouts are saved to a Steam cloud file, so if you play Vermintide 2 on multiple PCs using the same account, your loadouts should be automatically kept up to date on all of them without having to manually copy files.
[/list]

Version: 1.1.4
Changelist:
1.1.4: Fix breakage caused by Chaos Wastes update, and allow up to 30 loadouts to be saved per career.
1.1.3: Fix to allow equipping a melee weapon in the ranged slot for Grail Knight.
1.1.2: Fix for loadouts with Throwing Axes not working.
1.1.1: Fixes for breakage from changes in v2.0 of the game.
1.1.0: Added a few new features: bot override loadouts, right-click loadout number to restore it, and restore loadouts on hero-select screen when joining games.
1.0.6: Fix for another exploit which allowed items to be equipped in the wrong slots.
1.0.5: Fix for exploits which allowed items to be equipped on the wrong careers.
1.0.4: Don't rely on deprecated behaviour of hook library (repeatedly hooking same function).
1.0.3: Fix for breakage from changes in v1.2 of the game.
1.0.2: Fixes to work with hero/career switch in UI Improvements mod
1.0.1: Fixes for UI scaling
1.0.0: Initial release

On the player list shown when you press the Tab key, shows the equipment and talents each player is using.

Note: item traits and properties, and talents, will only be shown for connected players if they are also using this mod.

Version: 1.0.6
Changelist:
1.0.6: Disable the mod in Chaos Wastes mode to prevent error messages.
1.0.5: Fix for breakage caused by version 3.0 of the game.
1.0.4: Add support for Weave mode.
1.0.3: Disable the mod during Weaves so it doesn't crash the game, and avoid spewing error messages when the game claims there are more than 4 players.
1.0.2: Update for patch 2.0 of the game (support 6th talent for level 35 heroes).
1.0.1: Possible fix for network problems, and small adjustment of vertical positioning of widgets

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
[list]
    [*]The game setting 'Small Network Packets' (on the Network tab in the Options menu) may cause issues if enabled while using this mod.  I recommend leaving that setting OFF if you are using this mod.
    [*]People have reported that the host sometimes does not show the extra info (talents and item properties/traits) for connected clients.  I haven't been able to reproduce this, so if someone finds a reproducible test case, let me know.
